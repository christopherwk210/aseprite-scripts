# Aseprite Scripts
A collection of Lua scripts I've made to extend Aseprite.

To use any of the scripts in this repo, download the script you want (or just clone the whole repo) directly into your Aseprite script directory. You can open the scripts folder by doing `File > Scripts > Open Scripts Folder` from within Aseprite.

Learn about Aseprite scripting [here](https://github.com/aseprite/api).
